<h1> Definition Of Friction-Friction is a force that opposes the realative motion between two surfaces in contact is called friction .</h1>
             <h2><center> Type Of friction</center>
                       <P>      <center> ^</center>
              <P><center>THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF FRICTION.</center>
            <P> <center> 1. STATIC FRICTION .
              <P>2. SLIDING FRICTION .
              <P>3. ROLLING FRICTION .
              <P>4. FLUID FRICTION .</center></h2>
<H3>Frition and normal force are directly poportional to the contacting surface, and it doesn't depend on the hardness of the contacting surface . </h3>
<h4><BIG>STATIC FRICTION - Those frictional force acting onthe stative body then the body start motion these static force convernt into knietic force is callde static friction .
EXAMPALE -A box put in the flour the static friction so box and the surface of flour .</BIG></h4>
<h5> <BIG>KNICTIC FRICTION - The frictional force acting on two moving of bodys or objects is called knictic friction .</BIG></h5>
<h6>               <BIG><center>THERE ARE TWO TYPES FLUID AND ROLLING.</CENTER></BIG></H5>
<h7> <BIG>FLUID FRICTION - The force required to each the object moving with the same is a major a sliding friction come to clay when an object move along the surface of another object .</BIG></h7>
<H8> <big>ROLLING FRICTION - Wen a body rols over the surface of another object is callde rolling friction .
<P>Example - Moves wheel of car or cycle etc .</big></h8>
<p><h9> <BIG>[STATIC FRICTION >SLIDING FRICTION>ROLLING FRICTION]</BIG></H9>
<p><H10> <big>EFFECT OF FRICTION -Friction laved  we are and bear friction oppese of motion advantag.</big></h10>
<big><P><h11> ADVANTAGE OF FRICTION -Friction helps us waking and taring</big></h11>
<P><H12>. Speed of vehciles can we controlled only dew to friction.</h12>
<p><h13>.Without friction we cannot write .</h13>
<p><h14>.Friction helps us inapplied breakes .</h14>
<p><h15>.Friction helps to rolled objects in hand.</h15>
<p><h16>.Without friction nail cannot be fix in wood or surface.</big></h16>
<big><p><h17> DISSADVANTAGE OF FRICTION - Dew to excess of friction it defalt the commonents of machine.</h17>
<P><h18>.Friction reduce the efficency of machine .</h18>
<P><H19>.Loss of energy in the form heat.</H19>
<p><h20>.Friction caused were and tear dew to the life of mahcine get reduce .</h20>
<p><h21>.Friction effected screw ball earning soil of shose.</h21>
<P><H22>.The friction when effected the rail lines .</big></h22>
<big><p><h24>INSCREASING FRICTION - Friction can be increased by increasing the ruffenese of surface incontant .</big></h24>
<P><h25> EXAMPLE - Trading the type are increase to the friction .</h25>
<P><h26> REDUCING THE FRICTION - Decreasing friction reduce the surface ruppes of surface incontact when the surface is smooth the friction is minumn  .</h26>
<p><H27> EXAMPLE - Oil, Gress, Grey, fight are reduce the friction of machine .</big></h27>
<big><P><H28> LUBRICANT - The sunstance which reduce the fricion is called lubicant .</big></h28>

<big><p><h45>NATURAL GAS - Which materials found on nature are clled natural resources .</h45>
<P> EXAMPLE - Sunlight, Air, Water, Coal, Petroleum Etc .
<p> The natural resources can be categories into two parts .</big>
<big><p><h46>1.INEXHOUSTIBLE NATURAL RESOURCES - The resouces are present in the unlimited quantity in natural .</h46>
<p> EXAMPLE - Sunlight, Air, Water .</big>
<big><p><h47>2.EXHAUSTIBLE NATURAL RESOURCES - These resources in natural present in limited quantity it can be exhausted by human activity.</h47>
<p>EXAMPLE - Wildlife, Mineral, Petroleum, Coal, Naturalgas Etc.</big>
<big><p><h48>3.FOSSIL FUEL - Fossil fuel are fall from the dead remains of living organism .</h48>
<p>EXAMPLE - Coal, Petroaleum, Natural gas .
<P>4.COAL - Coal is a hard stone its colour is black and brown it consists of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and small amount of nitrogen and sulphur .</big>
<big><p><h49><center>5. EORMATION OF COAL:-</H49>
<p>THERE ARE 4 TYPE OF COAL .
<p>TYPE:- PEAT LIGNITE BITUMINOUS ANTHRACITE
<p>O/OOF  50%TO /60%TO/75%TO  /  85%TO95%
<P>CARBON 60%   /70%  / 85%
<P>6.USE OF COAL:-
<P>It is used indomestic purpose for cooking food.
<p>1.It was used in railway indian. 
<p>2.It was used in thermal power plant to produce electricity.
<p>3.It is also used in industries. 
<p>4.When coal burning in presence of air mainly produce carbon dioxide gas .</center></big>
<P><BIG><CENTER>FIG - 4</BIG></CENTER>
<P><BIG><H50>7.CARBONISTION:- The process of conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonisation .</big></h50>
<big><p><h51>8.FROMATION OF COAL:- About 300 million years ago the earth had dense forests in low living wetland areas. Due to natural processes, like flooding these forests got buried under the soil. As more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead plants got slowly converted to coal. As coal slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the slow process of conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonisation. </h51>
<p>Some useful product to produce coal.
<p>9.COKE:- It is a tough porous and black substance. It is used in the monufacture of steel and in the ectraction of many metals. </big>
<big><p><h52>10.COAL FOR:-It is a black, thick liquid the region of smell is sulfur. It is a mixture of about 200 substance. Coal tar are used in the formation of synthesis dyes, drags, explosives, perfurmes, platic point photo graphic materias, roofing meaterials naphthalene balls.</h52>
<p>11.COAL GAS:-Coal gas is obtained during the processing of coal to get coke. It is used as a fuel.</big>
<big><p><h53>12.PETROLEUM:-Petra+Oleam Petroleum in dark colour thick crue do it has unpleasent or derpetroleum is not a single chemical compound petroleum  is a single chemical compound petroleum is a complex mixer which are made up only  two elements carbon and hydrogen it is also called crued oil are mineral oil these substance is called hydrocarbon . The world' first oil well was drilled in penns yllania U.S.A in 1850. Eight years later in 1867, oil was struck at makum in asssam. In india oil is found in Assam, Gujarat, Mumbai high and in the river basims of godavari and krishna.</big></h53>

<P><big>13.REFINING OF PETROLEUM:-<p>1.Separation of water:- Oil + Water - Stable Mixture.
<p>2.Removing of sulphur:-Evo + St + - Cvsto (ppt).
<p>3.On heating 400.C infructional tower petroleum substance divide into seve substance - L.P.G, Petrol, Kersone, Dieselcubricating oil, paaffin wase, bitumen</big>
<p><big>14.Natural gas is store under high pressure as compressed natural gas .It is less polluting it is also called cleaner fuel.
<p>1.USES - It is used in power generation transport .
<p>2.It is used information of fertilliser.
<p>3.It is used for domestic purpose in home and it is uses in factory for fuel.
<p>4.It is used information of fetilisers.
<p>15.In our country natural gas has been found in Tripura, Rajstan, Maharastra, Sikkim and Krisnagodauri delta.
<p>16.SOME NATURAL RESOURCE ARE LIMITED:-
<P>.Drive at a constant and moderated speed as for as possible.
<p>.Switch off the engine at trafic lights or at a place where you have to wait.
<p>.Ensure correct tyre pressure.
<p>.Ensure regular maintenace of the vechile.</big>
<big><p><h54><MARQUEE SCROLLAMOUNT="5" BGCOLOR="PINK"DIRECTION="LEFT"> CHAPTER - CROP PRODUCTION AND MANFEMENT </BIG></H54></MARQUEE> <big.<p>When plants of the same kind are cultivaed at one place on a large scale it is also called a crop.
<P>EXAMPLE - Wheat, Mustard, ETC.</big>
<big><p>1. KHARIF CROP - The crop which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crop. The rainy season on INDIA is generally from JUNE to SEPTEMBER.
<p>EXAMPLE - Paddy, Maize, Soyabean ETC.</big> 
<big><p>2.RABI CROP - The crops grown in the  winter season (OCTOBER TO MARCH) are called rabi crops.
<P>EXAMPLE - Wheat, Gram, Pea, Mustard ETC.</big>
<big><p>3.JAYAD CROP - Jayad crop primarily grow during the summer from APRIL to JUNE during the brief period of time between kharif and rabi crops.
<p>EXAMPLE - The crop grow in summer sesson (APRIL - JUNE). Vegetable, Watermelon and Cucumber ETC.
<P> Some crop grow in annual cycle.
<p>EXAMPLE - Sugarcane and pulses ETC.
<p>The process of losening and furning  of tuning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing.</big>
<P>4.<BIG>AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS:-
<p>PLOUGH-This is being used since ancients time for tilling the soil, adding fertiliser and removing the weeds and turing the soil. this is madeup wood it contaions a strong triangular iron strip called plough share.
<p>The main part of the plough is a long log of wood which is called a plough shaft. One end attached beam which is place of bulls necks other end the handle of plough.
